I thought that this lab was a great way to ease back into web development. I hadn't really done any since the end of Intro of ITWS, which was 8-9 months ago. It wasn't too bad after reviewing my code from last year, which was the main resource I used. The only things I didn't recall how to do was to link an email, but it was super easy after I looked it up and I did the same with my phone number. I wasn't really familiar with the hCard microformat, so that took a bit of a research but I like how it turned out.
