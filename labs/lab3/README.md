I found this lab pretty straightforward. I was already familiar with API calls, plus the code snippet given in class made it really simple. I chose to use the Unsplash API to work in conjuction with OpenWeather because I thought it made a realistic web app template. The HTML Geolocation was pretty easy to integrate, the only blocker I ran into was how slow it is. It was taking a few seconds to update after the user clicks "allow location services," but adding the configuration to disable high accuracy, timeout after 5 seconds, and to use the cached location for up to 1 minute helped out.
