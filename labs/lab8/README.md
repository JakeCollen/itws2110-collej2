I found this lab pretty easy. I'm very familiar with SQL and PHPMyAdmin so the majority of the commands were easy to write. The only ones that I struggled at all with were the ones where we had to list out things in the table. I'd never used a "where greater than" command before but after looking it up I got it immediately. Sorry this lab is late, I missed the day of class before break and I was not expecting anything to be due during the break.
