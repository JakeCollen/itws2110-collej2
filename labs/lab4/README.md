Prompts given to ChatGPT:

create a web app to display the weather for troy ny using the openweather api. my api key is 00bf2ed667e73b694661859f30d1b7e2

use the unsplash api to make it better my api key is uT-vxVSaNa4CblrsomocfSdp5FXnDZREfP7h7atUgUI

use the html5 geolocation api to use the user's location rather than having troy as a default

use all of the information given by the openweather api and integrate it

sunrise and sunset are completely wrong

rewrite that in the whole file

round values given appropriately

change pressure to a more common unit like inhg

make the weather card look better than just a category with a ':'

use the emojis and put this all into the whole html

image appears way too zoomed in

image is not always what it should be, make sure the unsplash api is getting the right call

make the weather box look better

the emojis+weather categories look out of alignment


My feedback:
This was a very simple lab and it was especially so because I already made the lab by myself so I knew what I was looking to display and the roadblocks I'd likely run into. I finished the lab very quickly without much difficulty. It is kind of cool to see the default way that generative AI writes HTML/Javascript.
